## Algorithms for online PCA

The R package *onlinePCA* implements algorithms for online Principal Components Analysis and convenience functions for updating sample means and covariances. The provided algorithms are: 

- Recursive PCA based on a perturbation approach
- Recursive PCA based on secular equations
- Stochastic gradient algorithms (Stochastic Gradient Ascent and Subspace Networl Learning) with exact or neural networl implementation
